Decentralized Staking App
This is a project I built to explore how decentralized finance (DeFi) works and to create a simple, secure, and user-friendly platform for staking tokens. With this app, users can stake their tokens, earn rewards, and withdraw anytime—all with minimal effort.

What Does It Do?
Stake Your Tokens: Put your tokens to work with just a few clicks.
Earn Rewards: Watch your rewards grow in real time as the app calculates them automatically.
Withdraw Anytime: You can withdraw your tokens and rewards whenever you want. No lock-ins, no hassles.
Secure and Decentralized: Built on blockchain technology, your assets are safe, and every transaction is fully transparent.
